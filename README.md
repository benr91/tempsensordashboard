Documentation is skant here. Will be created soon. TBA

I created a temperature sensor dashboard for my Raspberry Pi to interpret the signals from an Arduino with 10K temperature probes attatched to respective ADC pins.

Graphing and manipulation, simple temperature table output from MySQL, the Python code to read the Ardunio serial and not forgetting the Arduino Sketch used to output the temperature readings to serial. I pulled the steinhart equation from the internet and am yet to investigate further but testing has concluded that the probes are accurate amongst themselves but not accurate to the temperature. Roughly 1-3 celsius off.
